This project is to create a Sign-up Form for a dummy service
It is a final project for the intermediate HTML/CSS course on The Odin Project
Requirements:
    -match all inputs on the example sign-up form provided
    -background-image
    -use an external font
    -form needs to have a password and confirm password input (confirm password will require JS to make sure both inputs match)
    -work with :valid and :invalid pseudoclasses to help with client-side validation
